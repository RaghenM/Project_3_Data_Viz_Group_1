# Project_3_Data_Viz_Group_1
# Goal of Class Project #3
  Data Viz track will tell a story using data visualizations. Interactivity sohuld be built in, allowing users to explore data on their own

# Data and Delivery 
- The dataset contains at least 100 unique records. 

- A database is used to house the data (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.). 

- The GitHub repo has a README.md that includes the following: 

  An overview of the project and its purpose

  Instructions on how to use and interact with the project

  At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made in the project

  References for the data source(s)

  References for any code used that is not your own

# Visualizations 
- A minimum of three unique views present the data. 
- The visualizations are presented in a clear, digestible manner. 
- The data story is easy to interpret for users of all levels. 

# Usability 
- The script, notebook, or webpage created to showcase data visualizations runs without error. 

- A Python or JavaScript library not shown in class is used in the project. 

- The project includes some level of user-driven interaction, conforming to one of the following designs: 

  HTML menus, dropdowns, and/or textboxes to display JavaScript-powered visualizations

  Flask backend with interactive API routes that serve back Python or JavaScript created plots

  Visualizations created from user-selected filtered data

  # Our Topic: U.S. Alternative Energy Vehicle Adoption 

  # Questions to be answered:
  1. Which states in the US are the most supportive of alternative energy vehicles? 

  2. Which states are the most supportive of Electric energy vehicles, and are they the same states or different from the collective alternative Energy TYPES? (Biodiesel, Ele, Ethanol (E85), Renewable Diesel) 

  3. Which states have the most efficient electric vehicle charging infrastructure? 
     - Which states are not ideal to travel through with an electric vehicle in the winter months?
